but then i noticed something

looks like whitespace cipher so i searched for tools until i found stegsnow 
```
stegsnow -C headup.txt
```
but this gave nonsense so i needed a password, the name was a hint (heads up = on earth look up = start), which was in the plotted picture, it was constellations, after googling it and trying constellations names, "orion" was the password 

```
stegsnow -C -p "orion" headup.txt
```
